# Given a string s, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of s. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

# A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "abc"
# Output: 7
# Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "aba"
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".
# Example 3:

# Input: s = "aaa"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".

class Solution:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
